basic-protobuf-archetype
========================

Yet-another protobuf archetype

This project is a basic protocol buffer Java project. It provides a location 
for .proto files and adds maven settings to generate the Proto Java files on 
each build.

* src/main/proto = Location for .proto files
* target/generated-sources = Location of Proto Java files

The project created from the archetype contains m2e lifecycle mappings
suitable for small scale protocol buffer projects.
